    "Words must be represented as **numeric vectors** in order to be fed into machine learning algorithms. One of the most powerful (and popular) ways to do it is through **Word Embeddings**. In word embedding models, each word in a given language is assigned to a high-dimensional vector, such that **the geometry of the vectors captures relations between the words**. \n",
